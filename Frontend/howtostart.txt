To start this application you need to start both server 
frontend and backend.
To start the frontend, go to the frontend folder and run the following command:
```
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
To start the backend, go to the backend folder and run the following command:
```
cd backend
uvicorn App.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload 
```
Once both applications are running, you can access the frontend at http://localhost:5173 and the backend at http://localhost:8000.
